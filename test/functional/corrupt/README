About viewing/editing those corrupted .class files.  Tools to use :

- javap -c : for viewing the bytecode. Keep in mind that this tool is not
  resilient to all the malformation tested (e.g. it fails at disassembling
  CorruptedIncompleteInsn.class).
- vim -b : for editing it. DO NOT FORGET the -b or the .class file will be
  rejected with an exception ClassFormatError which is probably not what
  you want. Additionaly, you will probably want to follow the instructions
  given at http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Improved_hex_editing to ease your
  editing.
